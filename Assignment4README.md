# Week 4 Assignment 
Submission for Coursera: Data Science, Getting and Cleaning Data.

## Submission Requirements
The assignment will be submitted by way of a github repository. The Course provides the data set to clean. UCI HAR Dataset was provided. The task is to write an R programming script to clean and present the data set.

### Deliverables
1.  TidyDataSet.txt 
2.  CodeBook.md
3.  run_analysis.R
4.  Provided source data (UCI HAR Datasets) in the working directory

### Review criteria 
1. The submitted data set is tidy.
2. The Github repo contains the required scripts.
3. GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
4. The README that explains the analysis files is clear and understandable.
5. The work submitted for this project is the work of the student who submitted it.

### Data Provided for the Task
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
